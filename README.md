## 🎯 North Star Metric
**Daily Active Users (DAU) / Monthly Active Users (MAU) Ratio**
*Focus: Driving habitual daily engagement rather than sporadic visits.*

## 📊 Key Metrics to Track
1.  **Retention Rate**: Day-1, Day-7, and Day-30 retention cohorts.
2.  **Streak Continuity**: % of users who maintain a 3+ day streak.
3.  **AI Interaction Rate**: % of sessions involving at least one AI conversation turn.
4.  **Gold Conversion Rate**: % of users upgrading to Gold after an AI nudge or Leaderboard interaction.

## 💡 Core Solutions & Features

### 1. Gamified Growth Engine
*   **XP System & Levels**: Users earn XP for every action (applying, quizzing, logging in), progressing from "Novice" to "Product Ninja".
*   **College Leaderboard**: Leverages social FOMO by showing users their rank against classmates (e.g., "You're 200 XP behind Rohan").
*   **Streak Tracker**: Visual "Heatmap" and streak counters create a sunk cost bias, encouraging daily logins.

### 2. "Nonstop" AI Mentor (The Copilot)
*   **Guided Flows**: Replaced open-ended chat with structured chip-based options (Competitions, Quizzes, Leaderboard) to reduce cognitive load.
*   **Contextual Nudges**: The AI knows your context (College: BITS Pilani, Rank: 3) and uses it to drive action.
*   **Monetization Focus**: Witty, persuasive prompts that position **Unstop Gold** as the "winning edge" for serious candidates.

### 3. A/B Testing Framework
*   **Variant A (Control)**: Standard "Competitions" grid view (Functional but passive).
*   **Variant B (Winner)**: The new Gamified Dashboard (Social, Interactive, Sticky).
*   **Hypothesis**: Variant B will show a **20-30% uplift in session time** and **15% increase in Day-7 retention**.
